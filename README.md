# Lim Pei Ting Data Analysis Portfolio 
## About 
Hi, I am Pei Ting. I have an analytical background with two years of experience as a Product Engineer. I have gained a strong expertise in data management, statistical analysis, and data visualization. By applying Statistical Process Control (SPC), Design of Experiments (DOE), and data-driven decision-making, I have successfully improved product yield by 0.4%. Additionally, I automated reporting processes, giving stakeholders real-time insights that facilitated better decision-making and enhanced operational efficiency. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analysis as a junior data analyst.

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Throughout my self-directed learning journey on online platforms, I have built a strong foundation in statistical analysis, data visualization, and programming languages like Python and SQL. By completing various courses and projects, I have gained practical experience in gathering, transforming, and structuring data for analysis to support informed decision-making.
