# My Portfolio 
## About 
Hi, I am Pei Ting. I have an analytical background with two years of experience as a Product Engineer, where I developed strong expertise in data management, statistical analysis, and automation. By leveraging techniques like Statistical Process Control (SPC), Design of Experiments (DOE), and data-driven methodologies, I achieved measurable improvements, such as enhancing product yield by 0.4%. I also automated reporting workflows to deliver real-time insights, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions and driving operational efficiency.  

Through self-directed learning and hands-on projects, I have built a solid foundation in data science and machine learning. I am proficient in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools, with experience in designing end-to-end workflows, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. Some of my key projects include stock price prediction using LSTMs and medical insurance cost prediction using machine learning algorithms.  

Additionally, I am pursuing an AWS certification to strengthen my cloud computing expertise and expand my ability to deploy, manage, and scale machine learning models and data pipelines in a cloud environment.  

I am passionate about solving real-world problems through data and am eager to apply my technical and analytical skills to contribute as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.  


## Experience
Infineon Technologies (M) Sdn Bhd

Product Engineer (PE)

December 2021 - May 2024

- Elevate process capability, minimize defects and enhance throughput in high-volume
manufacturing through the utilization of statistical process control (SPC), Design of Experiment
(DOE) techniques, data-driven decision making and systematic problem-solving expertise.
Successfully achieved 0.4% higher yield in fiscal year 2022/2023.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to create and execute data-driven solutions for business
challenges. Worked closely with Unit Process Engineers (UPE) to implement corrective actions and
process improvements, ensuring compliance with quality standards while enhancing product yield
and efficiency. Successfully reduced wafer break incidents from 58 cases to 21 cases between
fiscal years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023.
- Compiled and analyzed process data to create reports with CEDA (Common Engineering Data
Analysis) for assessing process yield performance. Developed automation reports that minimized
manual tasks, leading to improved efficiency in overall data analysis.
- Optimized Statistical Bin Analysis (SBA) to prevent invalid stops. Conducted statistical data
analysis and identified root causes of yield deviations, resolving any issues that may arise.
- Analyze and interpret large datasets to identify trends and insights that drive business decisions.
- Support Quality Department to ensure technology met qualification and reliability standards.
Managed data governance and quality processes, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data.
